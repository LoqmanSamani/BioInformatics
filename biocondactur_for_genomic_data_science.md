## Introduction

This class will provide an introduction to the Bioconductor project (http://bioconductor.org/
). The class will cover how to install and use Bioconductor software. We will discuss common data structures, including ExpressionSets, SummarizedExperiment and GRanges used across several types of analyses. Several popular packages for analysis and annotation of your data will be covered, including packages such as GenomicRanges, biomaRt, rtracklayer, AnnotationHub and others.

Course Content


### Week 1

    Introduction and pre-requisites (how to install R and bioconductor and give a ahoer introduction into bioconductor)

    What is Bioconductor (A long introduction into bioconductor and explain the main idea behind bioconductor)

    Installing Bioconductor

    The Bioconductor Website ( introduce bioconductor.org  and search in this website and get familiar with different parts of the website)

    Useful Online Resources ( online websites like rseek, rdocumentation, stackoverflow and the supportsite of bioconductor and how to get help from it.)

    R Base Types (here you will learn the basic of R, specific topics like vectors and matrix and datatypes and other basic and essential functionalities, which are commen amoung all programming languages will be teached.)

    Core Bioconductor functionality: GRanges and AnnotationHub (GRanges: a data structure for storing genomic intervals. AnnotaionHub: )

    IRanges (get familiar with package  IRanges and try to use the basic of it)

    GRanges from GenomicRanges (Definition, Usage, seqinfo)

    AnnotationHub

    Usecase - AnnotationHub and GRanges

### Week 2

    Biological strings in Bioconductor

    Biostrings

    BSgenome

    Intermediate usage of GenomicRanges

    Rle

    Transcription annotation in Bioconductor

    GenomicFeatures

    Importing data using rtracklayer

### Week 3

    Data containers and annotations

    ExpressionSet

    SummarizedExperiment

    Getting data online

    GEOquery

### Week 4

    Handling raw and aligned short reads.

    Basic usage of statistical models for differential expression.

    Preprocessing microarrays.

    Pre-requisites

    We assume some familiarity with the R language.

    A great introduction to R, is the class R programming taught by Roger Peng.



### Weekly quizzes

There are four weekly quizzes. You may begin submitting them as soon as the course opens. Quiz 1 is due at the end of the first week, Quiz 2 is due at the end of the second week, Quiz 3 is due at the end of the third week, and Quiz 4 is due at the end of the fourth week.
