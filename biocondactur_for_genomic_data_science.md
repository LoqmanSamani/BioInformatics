## Introduction

This class will provide an introduction to the Bioconductor project (http://bioconductor.org/
). The class will cover how to install and use Bioconductor software. We will discuss common data structures, including ExpressionSets, SummarizedExperiment and GRanges used across several types of analyses. Several popular packages for analysis and annotation of your data will be covered, including packages such as GenomicRanges, biomaRt, rtracklayer, AnnotationHub and others.
