## Course Title
### Command Line Tools for Genomic Data Science

## Course Instructor

### Liliana Florea, Ph.D.

### Course Description

#### This class will cover an introduction to command line tools for managing genomic data. It will start with basic Unix commands for managing files and directories, followed by a review of the main starndardized data formats and hands-on instruction on how to use popular tools such as Samtools, Bedtools, Bowtie, and application specific technologies such as Bcftools and Cufflinks. 

## Course Content
#### Unix Commands

- Basic commands

- Pipes

In the first week of this course, you will learn many specific and useful Unix commands, which are essential for basic text-based file analysis. In our case, these files contain biological information such as genome sequences, stored in formats like FASTA or FASTQ. What I found most valuable about the first week of this course was the detailed explanation of each command by Professor Liliana Florea. After watching the tutorial portion of the first week, you will be required to answer ten questions in a quiz. Following the quiz, there is an exam, which I believe can be challenging to pass successfully. Overall, the first week of this course has been one of the most informative sections I've encountered so far, and I genuinely appreciate Professor Liliana Florea for all the effort she has put into this fantastic course.
