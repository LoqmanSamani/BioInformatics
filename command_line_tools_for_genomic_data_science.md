## Course Title
### Command Line Tools for Genomic Data Science

## Course Instructor

### Liliana Florea, Ph.D.

### Course Description

#### This class will cover an introduction to command line tools for managing genomic data. It will start with basic Unix commands for managing files and directories, followed by a review of the main starndardized data formats and hands-on instruction on how to use popular tools such as Samtools, Bedtools, Bowtie, and application specific technologies such as Bcftools and Cufflinks. 

## Course Content

### Unix Commands

**Week 1 Overview**

- Basic commands

- Pipes

In the first week of this course, you will learn many specific and useful Unix commands, which are essential for basic text-based file analysis. In our case, these files contain biological information such as genome sequences, stored in formats like FASTA or FASTQ. What I found most valuable about the first week of this course was the detailed explanation of each command by Professor Liliana Florea. After watching the tutorial portion of the first week, you will be required to answer ten questions in a quiz. Following the quiz, there is an exam, which I believe can be challenging to pass successfully. Overall, the first week of this course has been one of the most informative sections I've encountered so far, and I genuinely appreciate Professor Liliana Florea for all the effort she has put into this fantastic course.





### Sequences and Genomic Features

**Week 2 Overview**

Week 2 of this course is divided into two main parts, each focused on distinct aspects of biological data handling and analysis. The first part is dedicated to gaining familiarity with various biological file formats. This includes popular sequence storage files like FASTA and FASTQ, as well as more specialized formats used to store data generated by next-generation sequencing tools, such as GTF, SAM, and BED files. These formats are fundamental for understanding and working with biological data.
The second part of the week is centered around using essential bioinformatics tools like Samtools and Bedtools through the command line to analyze data stored in the formats discussed in the first part. This practical experience will equip you with the skills needed to manipulate and interpret biological data effectively.

The course begins with an introduction to basic molecular concepts. While this may be familiar territory for molecular biologists, it provides essential foundational knowledge for data scientists or informaticians without a biological background.
In the first main part of the week, you'll delve into the specifics of various biological file formats. These formats are crucial for comprehending the subsequent section and are widely used in the field of genomics.
The second main part of the week introduces two powerful software packages: Samtools and Bedtools. You'll learn how to use these tools to analyze and manipulate biological data efficiently. These packages offer a wide range of functionalities for handling genomic information.

Just like in the first week, this section includes quizzes and exams to assess your knowledge and understanding of the course material. These assessments are valuable for gauging your progress and reinforcing your learning.


### Alignment and sequence variation

- Bowtie, BWA

- Samtools, Bcftools

- Application: variant calling

#### Transcriptomics

- Tophat

- Cufflinks

- IGV

- Application: RNA-seq analysis

#### Weekly quizzes

There are four weekly quizzes. You may begin submitting them as soon as the course opens. Quiz 1 is due at the end of the first week, Quiz 2 is due at the end of the second week, Quiz 3 is due at the end of the third week, and Quiz 4 is due at the end of the fourth week.
