# Bioinformatics Learning Repository

Welcome to my Bioinformatics Learning Repository! This repository is a collection
of my notes, code, and algorithms related to my journey in bioinformatics.
I'm sharing my knowledge and experiences as I learn about this fascinating field.
Feel free to explore, learn, and collaborate with me.


## About

Bioinformatics is an interdisciplinary field that combines biology,
computer science, and data analysis to extract meaningful insights 
from biological data.
This repository serves as my digital laboratory where I experiment
with various bioinformatics concepts, algorithms, and tools.



## Courses

I'm currently enrolled in the following bioinformatics courses:


1. **Bioinformatic Methods I**
   - Offered by: University of Toronto
   - Platform: Coursera
   - Description: An in-depth exploration of fundamental bioinformatic concepts and methods,
                  including database utilization, blast for sequence analysis, multiple sequence alignments,
                  phylogenetics, selection analysis, metagenomics



2. **Bioinformatic Methods II**
   - Offered by: University of Toronto
   - Platform: Coursera
   - Description: Building on the knowledge from Bioinformatic Methods I,
                  this course delves deeper into advanced topics such as structural
                  bioinformatics, protein-protein interactions, and network analysis.


3. **Introduction to Genomic Technologies**
   - Offered by: Johns Hopkins University
   - Platform: Coursera
   - Description: The basic biology of modern genomics and the experimental tools to measure it.
                  You  will  learn about  the central dogma of  molecular  biology  and  how next-generation
                  sequencing can be used to measure DNA, RNA, and epigenetic patterns. 


4. **Python for Genomic Data Science**
   - Offered by: Johns Hopkins University
   - Platform: Coursera
   - Description: an introduction to the Python programming language and the iPython notebook. 


5. **Algorithms for DNA Sequencing**
   - Offered by: Johns Hopkins University
   - Platform: Coursera
   - Description: Computational methods, algorithms, and data structures for analysis of DNA sequencing data.
                  Use of Python to implement key algorithms and data structures and to analyze real genomes
                  and DNA sequencing datasets.


6. **Command Line Tools for Genomic Data Science**
   - Offered by: Johns Hopkins University
   - Platform: Coursera
   - Description: Master the command-line tools and Unix-based environments commonly
                  used in genomic data analysis and bioinformatics pipelines.



7. **Bioconductor for Genomic Data Science**
   - Offered by: Johns Hopkins University
   - Platform: Coursera
   - Description: Dive into Bioconductor, a popular R-based platform for analyzing and 
                  visualizing high-throughput genomics data, including working with genomic annotations.


8. **Statistics for Genomic Data Science**
   - Offered by: Johns Hopkins University
   - Platform: Coursera
   - Description: Understand the statistical methods and concepts crucial for analyzing and
                  interpreting genomic data, covering topics like hypothesis testing, regression, and multiple testing correction.


These courses collectively provide a comprehensive foundation in bioinformatics and genomics,
equipping me with the knowledge and skills to tackle various bioinformatic challenges.
