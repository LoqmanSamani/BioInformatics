I would like to express my gratitude to Professor Nicholas James Provart from the University of Toronto for his captivating course on Coursera,

 "Bioinformatic Methods 1." This course comprises eight sections, providing a comprehensive introduction to various tools and methods widely 

used in the field of bioinformatics.

## Section 1: Exploring NCBI
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this first section, we delve into the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), an essential website in the realm of biology, particularly 

in biotechnology and computational biology. You'll become acquainted with the fundamentals of NCBI, such as navigation, database access, and query 

functionality. Furthermore, you will learn how to retrieve specific sequence information (DNA, RNA, or protein) using accession numbers and explore 

and interpret the acquired data. This understanding is foundational in bioinformatics. The section also covers vital concepts like homology and paralogy, 

followed by practical exercises involving BLAST (blastn) for different DNA sequences, along with analysis and result interpretation.

## Section 2: Deep Dive into BLAST
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the second section, we explore the BLAST tool on NCBI extensively. We cover various types of BLAST, including BlastP, PSI-Blast, and Translated Blast. 

Each type is thoroughly explained, and practical exercises involving different accession numbers are carried out. You'll also delve into advanced BLAST 

settings and how alterations in parameters impact results. Additionally, we discuss substitution matrices like PAM and BLOSUM and their effects on BLAST 

outcomes. The section concludes with an exploration of phylogenetic and clustering methods to identify orthologous genes. There is also a segment 

introducing specialized websites and tools like FlyBase, WormBase, and Mouse Genome Informatics, each dedicated to specific organisms and topics in 

comparative genomics.

## Section 3: Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In this section, you'll learn how to align sets of nucleotide and protein sequences from different organisms using MEGA 11, a popular software for multiple 

sequence alignment. Concepts of global and local sequence alignments are explained, including their applications and the scenarios in which each should 

be used. You'll explore different algorithms such as Clustal, Muscle, and MAFFT, understanding their differences and how to use them within MEGA. Practical 

MSA exercises using these algorithms are conducted, enabling you to analyze and identify disparities among them.

## Section 4: Review and Quiz
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This section serves as a refresher, with a quiz to consolidate the knowledge acquired in the previous three sections.

## Section 5: Phylogenetics
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The main focus of this section is phylogenetics and how to perform phylogenetic analysis using MEGA. Phylogenetic trees are instrumental in illustrating 

relationships between sequences, and you'll learn to construct and interpret them using methods such as neighbor-joining and maximum likelihood. 

All analyses are conducted through MEGA, providing insights into the differences between these methods.

## Section 6: Selection Analysis
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In this section, you'll gain insight into natural selection and its different types: negative, positive, and neutral selection, along with key terminology. 

The course covers how to perform selection analysis using DataMonkey, both at the gene and codon level. You'll thoroughly analyze the results generated 

by DataMonkey, enhancing your understanding of selection analyses.

## Section 7: Next-Generation Sequencing and RNA Sequencing
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The penultimate section focuses on next-generation sequencing, specifically RNA sequencing. You'll briefly explore the evolution of sequencing technologies 

and the revolutionary impact of next-generation sequencing in molecular biology. The course covers RNA sequencing using methods like Illumina and Nanopore, 

along with practical data analysis of Illumina-generated datasets.

## Section 8: Conclusion and Homework
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The final section includes a concluding quiz and homework assignment, combining elements of BLAST, multiple sequence alignment, and result analysis.
